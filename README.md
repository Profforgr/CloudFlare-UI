CloudFlare UI
=============

jQuery-based UI framework as seen on CloudFlare.com

About
-----

CloudFlare UI is a JavaScript project that was started as a UI framework for
cloudflare.com, and was originally based on jQuery UI. As the project evolved,
the jQuery UI Widget pattern no longer served as the best platform to base our
controls off of. We decided to create our own factory pattern that works in a
very similar way, but incorporates additional features that may or may never be
incorporated into jQuery UI. Ideas for features and functionality have been 
borrowed from many sources, and immense thanks goes out to the following
incredible projects, without which CloudFlare UI could not have been made:

* jQuery (http://jquery.com)
* jQuery UI (http://ui.jquery.com)
* QUnit (http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit)
* Adobe Flex SDK (http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/)
